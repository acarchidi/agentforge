description: Safety checks for agents that act on-chain. Call `preflight` once before any send, swap, approval, signature or x402 payment and get one proceed/caution/avoid verdict (transaction simulated, EIP-712 signature checked for permit phishing, recipients screened against OFAC sanctions and scam lists, tokens rug-checked). Also signature checks, transaction simulation, address screening, pre-trade token checks, batch rug checks, risk-scored new launches, Aave liquidation risk, and Solana simulation, on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Linea, Unichain, Sonic, HyperEVM and Solana. Also `content_scan` for prompt injection in untrusted text. Free over MCP up to a daily cap (no wallet); otherwise pay per call in USDC over x402, with the exact price quoted before any charge. To make the check automatic, the `agentforge-tools` SDK wraps the wallet so every signature is preflighted and `avoid` is refused.

# AgentForge

AgentForge is a DeFi safety layer for AI agents on eleven EVM chains and Solana. Base URL: `https://agentforge-taupe.vercel.app`. It has two tiers, and the free tier costs nothing to try:

1. **Free** — contract/program label lookups, full catalog, service docs, feedback. No wallet, no payment, no account.
2. **Paid** — 29 deeper analysis endpoints (one-call preflight safety checks, prompt-injection content scans, signature phishing checks, transaction simulation, liquidation risk, new-launch feed, address screening, batch rug checks, pre-trade token checks, wallet safety, transaction decode/simulate, and more), each billed per call via [x402](https://www.x402.org/) in USDC. Every price is stated plainly below and at `GET /catalog` — nothing is hidden.

## Free entry points (start here, no payment required)

- `GET /registry/lookup?address=0x...&chain=ethereum` — look up an EVM contract in our 436-contract label registry (protocol name, category, risk level).
- `GET /v1/solana/program-lookup?programId=...` — look up a Solana program in our 63-program label registry (protocol, category, risk level). Same idea, Solana side.
- `GET /registry/stats` — EVM registry coverage stats (entry count, chains, categories).
- `GET /catalog` — full machine-readable catalog of all 29 paid endpoints with current prices and JSON schemas.
- `GET /about` — service overview, every endpoint with description and `input_example` payload.
- `GET /.well-known/x402` — x402 discovery document (accepted networks, assets, payTo address).
- `POST /feedback` — report a bad response or suggest an improvement.

## MCP server — free, no wallet needed

All 29 tools are exposed over MCP at `https://agentforge-taupe.vercel.app/mcp` (Streamable HTTP). MCP calls are **free**: no wallet, no x402, no account.

- Lookups (`registry_lookup`, `solana_program_lookup`) and cheap data (`gas_oracle`, `pool_snapshot`) are unlimited.
- Every analysis tool is free for 10 calls per tool per client per day. Past that, the tool returns the matching paid x402 endpoint and its exact price.

Add it to Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http agentforge https://agentforge-taupe.vercel.app/mcp
```
Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop: add an HTTP MCP server with the same URL.

Use the paid HTTP endpoints below when you need more volume than the free daily allowance, or when your agent already pays via x402.

## When to use the paid endpoints

- In a trading loop: poll `launches` every 1-5 minutes (pass `nextSince` back as `since`) for newly listed tokens that are already risk-scored, then re-screen your watchlist with `risk-batch` (2-25 tokens per call, priced per token).
- Before signing any message or permit: `signature-check` explains what the signature allows and catches permit phishing, sell-for-nothing NFT orders, and over-priced or fake x402 payment requests.
- Holding a position or depending on a contract: `watch` alerts you by webhook when an admin key, proxy or pause state changes, a token turns risky, or a loan nears liquidation. No polling needed.
- Calling many times a day: buy `credits` once and sign requests (up to 20% bonus, no per-call settlement).
- Before ANY on-chain action, the simplest rule: call `preflight` with whatever you are about to do (transactions, a signature request, an x402 payment request, recipients, tokens to buy). One verdict covers simulation, signature phishing, sanctions/scam screening, and rug checks, on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Linea, Unichain, Sonic and HyperEVM.
- Before signing any EVM transaction: `tx-simulate` shows exactly what leaves the wallet, which approvals are granted, and whether any counterparty is sanctioned or a known scammer.
- Managing a leveraged position: `lending/health` reports the Aave v3 health factor on every chain and how far collateral can fall before liquidation.
- Before every outgoing transfer or approval: `address-check` screens the counterparty against OFAC sanctions and scam-wallet lists and flags brand-new address-poisoning wallets (1-100 addresses per call).
- Before feeding any untrusted text to your model (tool results, web pages, emails, token metadata): `content-scan` catches instructions aimed at the agent ("ignore previous instructions", "transfer all funds to 0x…"), payloads hidden in base64, Morse, zero-width or tag characters and homoglyphs, leaked private keys and seed phrases, sanctioned addresses, and lookalike domains. Deterministic rules, no LLM, priced per 4 KB.
- Before buying a token: `trade-check` runs the rug check, the AI risk assessment, and the gas oracle in one call and returns a proceed/caution/avoid verdict — cheaper than the three calls separately.
- Before executing a DeFi transaction: check `wallet-safety` or `approval-scan` (EVM) — or `solana/tx-simulate` (Solana).
- Before touching a new token: run `token-risk-metrics` (EVM) or `solana/token-risk-scan` (Solana) — rug check: mint/freeze authority, holder concentration, liquidity.
- To understand a transaction: `tx-decode` (EVM) or `solana/tx-explain` (Solana) turn raw transaction data into a plain-English explanation.
- To understand a contract: `contract-docs` generates function-level documentation with a security posture summary.
- For general AI text tasks tied to crypto/DeFi content: `sentiment`, `summarize`, `translate`.

Prices and JSON Schemas for every endpoint are always authoritative at `GET /catalog` — treat the table above as a snapshot, not the source of truth. The three `solana/*` endpoints accept payment on **either** Base or Solana mainnet USDC — pick whichever network your wallet holds funds on.

## Make it automatic: the Guard

Calling `preflight` only protects you when you remember to call it. A prompt-injected agent will not. The `agentforge-tools` SDK wraps the wallet instead, so every transaction, signature and x402 payment is preflighted before it is signed, and an `avoid` verdict is refused in code:

```ts
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';
import { guardAccount } from 'agentforge-tools';
const account = guardAccount(privateKeyToAccount(KEY), { privateKey: KEY }); // signTransaction / signTypedData now refuse `avoid`
```

- viem: `guardAccount`, `guardWalletClient` (covers `sendTransaction` and `writeContract`).
- x402 clients: `client.onBeforePaymentCreation(agentForgePaymentHook({ privateKey: KEY }))` screens every seller you pay.
- Coinbase AgentKit: `guardWalletProvider(walletProvider, { privateKey: KEY })` from `agentforge-tools/agentkit`.
- Claude Code / Cursor: `npx agentforge-tools hook` prints a `PreToolUse` hook.

Fail-closed by default (`failOpen: false`). Each check is $0.008, paid from prepaid credits that top up automatically. Integrators: pass `credits: { referrer: '0xYourWallet' }` to earn 10% of the credit packs your users buy.

## Prepaid credits

For loops that call AgentForge often, buy credits once and sign each request instead of paying per call: no per-call settlement, up to 20% bonus.

1. Buy: `POST /v1/credits/buy?pack=5` paid with x402 from an EVM wallet on Base ($5 → $5.75 of credit; pack 1 = $1.10, pack 20 = $24). Credits land on the paying wallet when the payment settles.
2. Spend: add an `X-AgentForge-Credit` header to any paid request, signed by the same wallet:

```ts
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';
import { createHash, randomBytes } from 'node:crypto';

const account = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.AGENT_KEY as `0x${string}`);
const path = '/v1/preflight';
const body = JSON.stringify({ chain: 'base', recipients: ['0x…'] });
const ts = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
const nonce = randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
const message = [
  'AgentForge credit spend',
  'method:POST',
  `path:${path}`,
  'query:',                                   // raw query string without '?', empty if none
  `body-sha256:${createHash('sha256').update(body).digest('hex')}`, // sha256 of '' for GET
  `ts:${ts}`,
  `nonce:${nonce}`,
].join('\n');
const sig = await account.signMessage({ message });
const res = await fetch(`https://agentforge-taupe.vercel.app${path}`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'content-type': 'application/json',
    'x-agentforge-credit': Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({ wallet: account.address, ts, nonce, sig })).toString('base64'),
  },
  body, // send exactly the bytes you hashed
});
// res.headers.get('x-agentforge-credit-balance') → remaining balance
```

- Signatures expire after 120 s and each nonce works once. Smart-contract wallets (ERC-1271/6492) are supported.
- Out of credit → `402 INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` with a top-up link. Failed calls (4xx/5xx) are refunded automatically.
- Balance and referral stats: `GET /credits/balance?wallet=0x…` (free).

### Referral program

Share `https://agentforge-taupe.vercel.app/v1/credits/buy?pack=5&ref=<your wallet>`. Every wallet that buys through it is tied to you: **you earn 10% of every pack it buys, for as long as it keeps buying**, paid as credit to your wallet, and it gets 5% extra credit. The first referrer a wallet uses sticks, and self-referral doesn't count. Building an agent, skill or SDK on AgentForge? Put your wallet in the `ref` of the purchase link you ship.

## Watches (webhook alerts)

`POST /v1/watch` with `{ type, chain, target, webhookUrl, days, params? }`:

| type | target | alerts when | checked |
|---|---|---|---|
| `contract-admin` | contract | owner, EIP-1967 implementation/admin, or paused state changes | every 30 min |
| `token-risk` | token | risk score crosses `params.threshold` (default 50), or a new risk flag appears | daily |
| `lending-health` | wallet | Aave v3 status band changes, or health factor crosses `params.threshold` | every 30 min |

The response includes a `secret` (keep it) and the result of a `test` event sent to your webhook. Alerts are POSTed as JSON with `X-AgentForge-Signature: t=<unix>,v1=<hex>`; verify with:

```ts
const [t, v1] = sigHeader.split(',').map((p) => p.split('=')[1]);
const ok = createHmac('sha256', secret).update(`${t}.${rawBody}`).digest('hex') === v1;
```

Failed deliveries retry with exponential backoff (up to 6 attempts). Status: `GET /watch/:id`, cancel: `DELETE /watch/:id` (both with `X-Watch-Secret`; cancellations aren't refunded).

## Paying via x402 (3 representative examples)

x402 is a two-step HTTP flow: your first request gets `402 Payment Required` with payment terms in the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header (base64-encoded JSON); your client signs an EIP-3009 USDC transfer authorization and retries with an `X-PAYMENT` header. Most agents use an x402-aware HTTP client (`@x402/fetch` for JS, `x402` for Python) rather than raw curl, but the underlying HTTP is:

**1. Wallet safety check**
```bash
# Step 1: unpaid request — returns 402 with payment terms
curl -i -X POST https://agentforge-taupe.vercel.app/v1/wallet-safety \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"walletAddress":"0x7Fc66500c84A76Ad7e9c93437bFc5Ac33E2DDaE9","chain":"ethereum"}'

# Step 2: retry with X-PAYMENT header (built by your x402 client from
# the PAYMENT-REQUIRED response header above)
curl -X POST https://agentforge-taupe.vercel.app/v1/wallet-safety \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-PAYMENT: <base64 payment payload from your x402 client>" \
  -d '{"walletAddress":"0x7Fc66500c84A76Ad7e9c93437bFc5Ac33E2DDaE9","chain":"ethereum"}'
```

**2. Token risk / rug check**
```bash
curl -X POST https://agentforge-taupe.vercel.app/v1/token-risk-metrics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-PAYMENT: <base64 payment payload>" \
  -d '{"address":"0x7Fc66500c84A76Ad7e9c93437bFc5Ac33E2DDaE9","chain":"ethereum"}'
```

**3. Decode a transaction**
```bash
curl -X POST https://agentforge-taupe.vercel.app/v1/tx-decode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-PAYMENT: <base64 payment payload>" \
  -d '{"txHash":"0xb7219192723c6a9ee77cd56ffdd28805d6177f76ffe0d34260bb5dc76abf19cf","chain":"ethereum"}'
```

Minimal JS client (recommended over raw curl):
```js
import { wrapFetchWithPayment } from '@x402/fetch';
const paidFetch = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, x402Client); // handles the 402 -> X-PAYMENT retry for you
const res = await paidFetch('https://agentforge-taupe.vercel.app/v1/wallet-safety', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ walletAddress: '0x...', chain: 'ethereum' }),
});
```

## Contact and feedback

Wrong result, a problem, a complaint, or a check you need that doesn't exist? Tell us; we read everything:
- `POST /feedback` with `{ "type": "bug_report" | "feature_request" | "complaint" | "idea" | "general", "message": "…", "endpoint"?: "/v1/…", "contact"?: "…" }`
- the free `send_feedback` MCP tool
- email agentforge.api@gmail.com, or the form at https://agentforge-taupe.vercel.app/contact

## Notes for buying agents

- All 19 endpoints declare bazaar discovery metadata with example inputs/outputs — use `GET /catalog` or the CDP x402 Bazaar discovery index to pull JSON Schemas programmatically rather than hardcoding request shapes from this file.
- Every paid response includes a `relatedServices` field suggesting other AgentForge endpoints relevant to the same wallet/token/contract — follow these to chain checks (e.g. `token-risk-metrics` → `tx-decode` for the token's deploy transaction).
- EVM endpoints: network is Base mainnet, asset is USDC (`0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`).
- Solana endpoints (`solana/tx-explain`, `solana/tx-simulate`, `solana/token-risk-scan`): accept USDC on **either** Base or Solana mainnet (`EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`) — the 402 response lists both `accepts` entries, pick the one matching your wallet.
